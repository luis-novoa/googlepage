The objective of this project is to help me develop and practice my skills on HTML and CSS. After completed, I may update this file with my final thoughts of what I achieved with this.
I will try to mimic the google home page and results page.
This is part of The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Final thoughts: I'm proud of this work. I achieved more than I expected, although the page isn't 100% identical to the original. I learned how important is the practical work for the learning process, and also how much time and mental wellness you improve if you stop being stubborn and seek help from other programmers through Google.
