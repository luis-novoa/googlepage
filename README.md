This project has the objective of helping me develop and practice my skills on HTML and CSS. After completed, I may update this file with my final thoughts of what I achieved with this.
I will try to mimic the google home page and results page.
This is part of The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
